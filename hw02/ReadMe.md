I have finished "Buttons and LEDS" and "Etch-a-sketch" Javascript game.
Stored in two .js source code files.

"Button and LEDs":
Four buttons: P9_13, P9_11, P9_21, P9_17
controls
Four LEDs: P9_24, P9_27, P9_22, P9_26
Only when the button is pressed, the LED goes on. 

"Etch-a-sketch":
My Etch-a-sketch takes four buttons to control direction: P9_13, P9_11, P9_21, P9_17
and button P9_23 to clear the sketch area.

the size of screen is defined in variable MAXSIZE, range 1-100.
